# Hours Counter
A small QtQuick application I made for myself to keep track of the work for hourly paid jobs.
Backed from a Sqlite database, tested on PC and Android but it's so simple it should run on any platform that Qt compiles to.
It also has translation support, currently works in English and Italian.
